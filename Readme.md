This Bash System Maintenance Suite provides a simple, menu-driven interface ```main.sh``` to automate key Linux admin tasks: creating backups ```backup.sh```, running system updates ```maintenance.sh```, and monitoring logs ```log_monitor.sh```. To use it, first make all scripts executable ```chmod +x *.sh```. You must then edit the ```SOURCE_DIR/BACKUP_DIR``` variables in backup.sh and the ```LOG_FILE``` variable in log_monitor.sh to match your system. Run ```./main.sh``` to launch the menu and select a task. All actions are automatically recorded in ```maintenance_suite.log``` for review.
